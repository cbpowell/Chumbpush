A python script to take (short) emails from an IMAP server, shorten the URLs with Bit.ly, and post them to Twitter. It currently uses IMAP IDLE to watch for new emails, and perform the previously stated actions when one is received.

Intended originally to be used to tweet emails sent from a Chumby, but it can be easily modified to watch for emails in a wide range of criteria (sender, subject, folder/Gmail label, content).

Dependencies:
imaplib2 (http://www.janeelix.com/piers/python/imaplib.html)
python-twitter* (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
python-bitly* (http://code.google.com/p/python-bitly/)
*Note: these dependencies have sub-dependencies

Using:
First, edit the config.ini file in the same directory as Chumbpush.py, adding your configuration details.

- IMAP - add your server, username, and password (sorry, plaintext!)
- Twitter - You'll need to register a new application with Twitter, and enter  the associated Consumer key and Consumer secret. Then, using get_access_token.py (with your Consumer key and secret), get your access_token_key and access_token_secret and add them as well
- Bit.ly - add your bit.ly login and API key

When run using python Chumbpush.py, unread emails in the Chumby folder will be grabbed, shortened, and posted!

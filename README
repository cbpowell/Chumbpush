A python script to take (short) emails from an IMAP server, shorten the URLs with Bit.ly, and post them to Twitter. It currently uses IMAP IDLE to watch for new emails for a specified amount of time (going to add an option to stop soon), and acts when one is received.

Dependencies:
imaplib2 (http://www.janeelix.com/piers/python/imaplib.html)
python-twitter* (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
python-bitly* (http://code.google.com/p/python-bitly/)
*Note: these dependencies have sub-dependencies

Using:
First, edit the config.ini file in the same directory as Chumbpush.py, adding your configuration details.

- IMAP - add your server, username, and password (sorry, plaintext!)
- Twitter - You'll need to register a new application with Twitter, and enter  the associated Consumer key and Consumer secret. Then, using get_access_token.py (with your Consumer key and secret), get your access_token_key and access_token_secret and add them as well
- Bit.ly - add your bit.ly login and API key

When run using python Chumbpush.py, unread emails in the Chumby folder will be grabbed, shortened, and posted!

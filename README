A python script to take (short) emails from an IMAP server, shorten the URLs with Bit.ly, and post them to Twitter.

Dependencies:
python-twitter (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
python-bitly (http://code.google.com/p/python-bitly/)
*Note: these dependencies have sub-dependencies

Using:
First, edit the config.ini file in the same directory as Chumbpush.py, adding your configuration details.

- IMAP - add your server, username, and password (sorry, plaintext!)
- Twitter - You'll need to register a new application with Twitter, and enter  the associated Consumer key and Consumer secret. Then, using get_access_token.py (with your Consumer key and secret), get your access_token_key and access_token_secret and add them as well
- Bit.ly - add your bit.ly login and API key

When run using python Chumbpush.py, unread emails in the Chumby folder will be grabbed, shortened, and posted!
